# 👋 Hi, I'm Saidimu

## 🧠 Systems Engineer | Software Architect | Entrepreneur

I build modular systems and developer tools that prioritize clarity, composability, and long-term maintainability. As both an engineer and entrepreneur, I bring a systems-level mindset to designing software, automating workflows, and scaling infrastructure — whether in open source or production environments.

I maintain open-source packages under the [@asaidimu](https://www.npmjs.com/~asaidimu) organization and lead technical initiatives across ventures focused on automation, developer experience, and system reliability.
